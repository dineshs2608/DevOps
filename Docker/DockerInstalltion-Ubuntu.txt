Installation of Docker on Ubuntu 
(https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)

Install using the repository
Before you install Docker Engine - Community for the first time on a new host machine, you need to set up the Docker repository. Afterward, you can install and update Docker from the repository.

SET UP THE REPOSITORY
1) Update the apt package index:

 sudo apt-get update

2) Install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:
sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg-agent \
    software-properties-common

3) Add Docker’s official GPG key:
3.a) curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

Verify that you now have the key with the fingerprint 9DC8 5822 9FC7 DD38 854A E2D8 8D81 803C 0EBF CD88, by searching for the last 8 characters of the fingerprint.

3.b) sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88


4) Use the following command to set up the stable repository. To add the nightly or test repository, add the word nightly or test (or both) after the word stable in the commands below. Learn about nightly and test channels.

 sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"





INSTALL DOCKER ENGINE - COMMUNITY

1) Update the apt package index.
$sudo apt-get update

2) Install the latest version of Docker Engine - Community and containerd, or go to the next step to install a specific version:

sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

3) Verify that Docker Engine - Community is installed correctly by running the hello-world image.

 sudo docker run hello-world

4)Executing Docker without sudo

If you want to avoid typing sudo whenever you run the docker command, add your user to the docker group:

$ sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}

To apply the new group membership, you can log out of the server and back in, or you can type the following:
$ su - ${USER}

           
You will be prompted to enter your user's password to continue. Afterwards, you can confirm that your user is now added to the docker group by typing:

$ id -nG
