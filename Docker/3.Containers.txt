Containers:
Containers are running instances of Docker Images

A container image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package of a piece of software that includes everything needed to run it: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, settings


Google docker architecture

 
: docker run hello-world
: docker ps
: docker run --name test -it ubuntu
: docker start ContainerName/ID
: docker stop ContainerName/ID

** open other terminal to see status**

: docker pause ContainerName/ID
: docker unpause  ContainerName/ID

: docker top ContainerName/ID
: docker stats ContainerName/ID

: docker attach ContainerName/ID

: docker kill ContainerName/ID
: docker rm ContainerName/ID

: docker history ImageName/ID



Features of Containers:

*Are lightweight
*Fewer resources are used
*Booting of containers is very fast
*Can start, stop, kill, remove containers easily and quickly
*Operating System resources can be shared within Docker
*Containers run on the same machine sharing the same Operating system Kernel, this makes it faster
